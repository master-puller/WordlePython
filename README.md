# WordlePython
A simple wordle game made in 100 lines of code.

As of now, the client will accept user-input, you can import the library and start a Wordle Game by instantiating the class.
Large files are pretty slow, so it is suggested to chunk up the files, and randomly choose one to input. Memory usage is very minimal.

You can use this to test wordle bots.
